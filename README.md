# The Whisky Realm

# Overview
The Whisky Realm is a web application that immerses you in the kingdom of whisky. Every registered user can write reviews of whiskies, add them to favorites, and rate them. Users can also leave comments under articles and join Whisky events. In addition to the regular user, there is a role - Whisky Expert, which is given exclusively by the Administrator. This role allows the creation of whisky events, writing interesting whisky-themed articles, as well as adding new whiskies and awards won by them at Whisky festivals and others. However, each new whisky must first be approved by the Administrator to start appearing for all users. The third role is that of the administrator, who has access to all data and can add, modify, and delete both the data and the users themselves.
